# Release Management

## Overview
The release management process automates versioning, changelog generation, artifact building, and deployment across environments.

## Release Process

### 1. Version Bumping
Releases follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or significant new features
- **MINOR**: New features, non-breaking additions
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, performance improvements, minor changes

### 2. Automated Release
```bash
# Create a patch release
./scripts/release-automation.sh patch

# Create a minor release
./scripts/release-automation.sh minor

# Create a major release
./scripts/release-automation.sh major
```

### 3. What the Release Script Does
1. Validates the working tree is clean
2. Ensures you're on the release branch
3. Fetches latest code from remote
4. Calculates the new version number
5. Updates version in all relevant files (Chart.yaml, package.json)
6. Creates a git tag
7. Builds all release artifacts
8. Generates release notes

### 4. Changelog Generation
```bash
# Generate full changelog
./scripts/changelog-generator.sh

# Generate changelog since specific tag
./scripts/changelog-generator.sh CHANGELOG.md v1.0.0
```

### 5. Release Notes
```bash
# Generate release notes for a version
./scripts/release-notes.sh v1.2.3
```

## Release Workflows

### GitHub Actions
The release management workflow (`.github/workflows/release-management.yml`) runs automatically when a `v*` tag is pushed:

1. **Validate**: Verify the tag format
2. **Build**: Build and push Docker images to GHCR
3. **Release**: Create a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
4. **Deploy**: Deploy to staging environment
5. **Notify**: Send Slack notification to the team

### Manual Release
```bash
# On main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Run release automation
./scripts/release-automation.sh patch

# Push the tag
git push origin main --tags
```

## Release Tracking
```bash
# View release status
./scripts/release-tracking.sh status

# List all releases
./scripts/release-tracking.sh list

# Show release details
./scripts/release-tracking.sh show v1.2.3

# View pending changes
./scripts/release-tracking.sh pending
```

## Artifacts
Each release produces:
- Docker images: `ghcr.io/xoulomon/scavenger-{service}:{version}`
- Helm chart: Updated version in `k8s/Chart.yaml`
- Git tag: `v{version}`
- GitHub Release with release notes

## Version Files
The following files are updated during a release:
- `k8s/Chart.yaml` - Helm chart version
- `frontend/package.json` - Frontend version
- `packages/scavenger-sdk/package.json` - SDK version

## Best Practices
1. Always test release candidates in staging before production
2. Tag releases immediately after merging to main
3. Write clear, descriptive commit messages using conventional commits
4. Generate and review changelog before each release
5. Verify all artifacts are published after release
6. Document any breaking changes prominently in release notes
